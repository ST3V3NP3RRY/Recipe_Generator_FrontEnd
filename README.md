# Recipe Finder

## Capstone Project

## Introduction
This project is the culmination of all that we have learned while studying professional Software development with CodeClan. The main purpose of this app is to provide families with healthy recipes for meal planning as well as try to eliminate food waste by allowing the users to curate a shopping list of ingredients required to make each recipe from the application. The technologies used to build the application are as follows:

* Front-end - HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and React to create and update the user interface
* Back-end - Java, spring boot, H2 SQL (relational-database) to create the API and serve the data to the front end of the application.
